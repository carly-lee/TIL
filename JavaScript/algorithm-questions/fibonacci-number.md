# [Fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)

[The Fibonacci numbers are generated by setting **_F(0)=0, F(1)=1_**, and then using the recursive formula **_F(n)=F(n-1) + F(n-2)_** to get the rest.](https://www.math.hmc.edu/funfacts/ffiles/10002.4-5.shtml)

Make a function returns Nth fibonacci number when it receives a number which is bigger than 1.

```javascript
var fibonacci = function(n){
    var current, prev = 1, prevPrev= 0;
  if( n<2 ) n;
  for( var i = 2; i<=n; i++ ){
    current = prev + prevPrev; // 1 + 0;
    prevPrev = prev; // 1;
    prev = current; // 1;
  }
  return current; // 1
}

fibonacci(100);
```
When you use a recursive function and want to care about performance at the same time, the recursive function should be called the last in the function.
[Explanation in Korean](http://ledgku.tistory.com/37)


```javascript
var fibonacci = function(num, memo) {
  if( num < 2 ) return num;
    memo = memo || {};
  if (memo[num]) return memo[num];

  return memo[num] = fibonacci(num - 1, memo) + fibonacci(num - 2, memo);
}
```

1 = 1  
2 = (2-1) + (2-2) = 1  
3 = 1 + 1 = 2  
4 = 2 + 1 = 3  
5 = 3 + 2 = 5  
6 = 5 + 3 = 8  
7 = 8 + 5 = 13  
8 = 13 + 8 = 21  
9 = 21 + 13 = 34  
10 = 34 + 21 = 55  

As you can see in the above example, the number should go through the equation if the number is grater than 1.    
If the number is small, that would not be a big issue. However, if the number is huge, it will hurt performance badly.
In order to prevent performance issue, it is recommended to record numbers that have been calculated into memory.

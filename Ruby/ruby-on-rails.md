# Ruby on Rails

- Setting a value as unique in database - Add `unique` option to the databease. Do not put `uniqueness` into the model. It doesn't prevent multi thread issue 

- DB migration code can be deleted after updating schema.

- path method automatically generated by routes when `resource/s` are used.

resources :users -> user/ users/ users/:id ... also creates `users_path` and `user_path` which can be used instead of hardcored url.
